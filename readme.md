# TermiNET

## What is TermiNET?
TermiNET is a small command-line client that lets you browse, view and buy NET products.

## Motivation:
TermiNET is aimed to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the “parser” (the NET e-commerce main component, which cannot be shared though). 
It was created by me, in a weekend, at home, without any leverage or privileged code or access to NET systems.

## How it works:
TermiNET simulate a Linux console, where you type commands to list, describe and actually buy NET products.

## How to use:
To use it, simply access TermiNET and start typing the commands.

### The commands:

- *ls* : lists the product categories / available products in your location
- *cd* : enters in a product category / product
- *cd /* : back to start
- *cd ..* : returns to previous category
- *cd /cart* : goes to the shopping cart
- *cat* : shows the product details
- *commit* : adds a product to the shopping cart
- *push* : asks for your personal data and then sends your order
- *help* : shows this list
